> Pearson components for standardize the next gen UIs.

## What is it
In a nutshell, the UX Framework defines a unified visual voice for Pearson’s applications and provides a library of components that makes implementing the voice quick and easy.

## Goals
Consistency and Efficiency are the primary objectives of the Framework. Consistency in our product experiences is a prerequisite for meeting the bar set by the consumer software our users already interact with everyday. Regular, predictable design allows us to strengthen Pearson’s brand with a familiar voice and create a desirable platform for learning. A consistent design also implies consistent development effort behind the scenes. An efficient implementation pattern allows sharing and duplication reduction, speeding up the process of designing and developing products.

## Benefits
A consistent and efficient foundation unlocks a variety of benefits which would be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to achieve otherwise.
 - Reduced duplication of effort from both design and development
 - Deployment of a revised and enhanced brand identity
 - Faster time to market for new products, with higher quality implementations
 - Leveling up our product experience to become truly desirable
